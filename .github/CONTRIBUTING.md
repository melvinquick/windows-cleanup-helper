## How to contribute to the Windows Cleanup Helper

#### Did you find a bug?

- Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, and instead to refer to our [Security Policy](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/security/policy).

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new bug report](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Be sure to include a title and clear description of the issue, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- The [Project Goals](https://github.com/users/melvinquick/projects/5/views/1) Document is a great place to start! If you would like to assist, please take a look here first!

- If the feature isn't something already on the Project Goals Document, consider [opening a new feature request](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

- If you want to try your hand at implementing the feature, [open a pull request](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/compare) once you have a working and tested version.

#### Any other questions/comments/concerns?

- Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/issues) with the question label and we will respond as soon as we can!
