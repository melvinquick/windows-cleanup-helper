# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this script doesn't have a downloadable release, there will be no "supported versions". I will update code to whatever is compatible with PowerShell as Microsoft pushes updates to it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Here's how you can [report a known vulnerability](https://github.com/melvinquick/windows-cleanup-helper/security/advisories/new).

I will do my best to update the Windows Setup Script code / and the PowerShell version I'm running as soon as possible to correct any known vulnerabilities.
