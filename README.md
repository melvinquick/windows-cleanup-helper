## Purpose

The goal of this script is to create an easy way for anyone to clean up junk from their Windows OS System without needing to install any additional software. I use this personally and while it doesn't get EVERYTHING, it does get a lot of junk from common places it can build up.

## Instructions

To run, open PowerShell as an admin user and copy/paste the following into it, then hit enter:

```
IWR wch.melvinquick.com | IEX
```
